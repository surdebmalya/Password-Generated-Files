# Password-Generated-Files
Here I try to make a Code that can make a file whose name is not associated with any other files in that directory. 
If the same name is already in the directory, then it will generate a warning, and will ask for another name.
If it matchs the condition then it will ask for the password.
In case of Log In, if the user id is not matching, the code will ask for the proper user id untill it will find a valid user id.
Then it will ask for the password that has been given to that particular file when it has been created.
If the password matchs then it will generate a output that Log in successful!!!
